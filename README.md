# Angular Rich Text Editor
A rich text editor directive plugin in angularjs

demo: (http://cslab.org/texteditor)

Itâ€™s a WYSIWYG rich text editor. For a more versatile WSIWYG text editor in angular see (http://textangular.com/)
BUT, I would recommend a markdown text editor in stead. (Similar to the text editor in stackexchage, where you write in plain text, and it will be converted to HTML, which can be previewed (under/side by side) separately)
See: [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked), [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) & [markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) for some examples.
